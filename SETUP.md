# ScreenSense AI — Setup Guide (Windows)

## What You're Installing

A floating AI orb that lives on your Windows desktop. Click it to get:
- **Live Captions** — real-time subtitles on any video or Google Meet
- **Scene Explainer** — AI reads what's being *taught* on screen (not just described)
- **Transcript Notes** — full session notes exported as Markdown/PDF
- **Video Summarizer** — NotebookLM-style summary with chapters
- **AI Fake Detector** — checks if the on-screen video looks AI-generated or deepfake

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
Download from https://nodejs.org and install.
Verify: open Command Prompt and run `node --version`

### 2. VB-Cable (FREE — for system audio capture)
This lets ScreenSense hear what's playing through your speakers.

1. Download from: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
2. Run `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` as Administrator
3. After install, go to **Control Panel → Sound → Recording**
4. You'll see "CABLE Output" — right-click → Set as Default Device
5. Go to **Playback** → right-click "CABLE Input" → Properties → Listen tab → check "Listen to this device" → select your speakers

> **Note for Google Meet specifically:** Chrome will pick up your microphone directly via the browser. VB-Cable is for capturing video audio (YouTube, VLC, etc.)

### 3. Local Whisper

Live captions and transcript capture run through a local faster-whisper server. No Whisper API key is used.

```bash
py -3.13 -m pip install -r requirements-local-whisper.txt
py -3.13 local_whisper_server.py
```

Keep this terminal open while using Live Captions or Transcript Notes. The default model is `tiny` for faster local captions. To use a more accurate Whisper size, set `WHISPER_MODEL` before launching, for example `WHISPER_MODEL=base` or `WHISPER_MODEL=small`. You can also tune `WHISPER_DEVICE` and `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` for your hardware.

Local Whisper also needs `ffmpeg` on PATH so it can read browser audio chunks.

On Windows, you can also double-click `start-local-whisper.bat`. If `python --version` opens Microsoft Store, install Python from python.org and tick "Add python.exe to PATH", or disable the Python app execution aliases in Windows Settings.

### 4. API Keys

**Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** — use your own free provider keys for scene analysis and summaries.
- Sign up for Groq, Google AI Studio, Mistral, and Together AI. Each provider offers a free tier with daily limits.
- Store your keys in `.env.local` in the project root using names like `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, and `TOGETHER_AI_KEY`.
- Example `.env.local`:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_...
GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY=...
MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
TOGETHER_AI_KEY=...
```
- Live transcription does not need this.
- Scene Explainer, chat, summaries, and translated/cleaned captions can use your configured BYOK provider.

**Anthropic API Key** (optional — for superior summaries)
- Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com
- Go to API Keys → Create key
- Used only for the Summarizer mode

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone or download this folder to your desktop

# 2. Open Command Prompt in the screensense-ai folder:
cd path\to\screensense-ai

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. In a separate terminal, start local Whisper
py -3.13 -m pip install -r requirements-local-whisper.txt
py -3.13 local_whisper_server.py

# 5. Launch the app
npm start
```

The orb will appear in the bottom-right of your screen.

---

## First-Time Setup

1. Click the orb → click ⚙ (Settings)
2. Paste your own Groq or OpenAI API key for scene/chat/summary features, or create a `.env.local` file with your BYOK provider keys.
3. Optionally paste your Anthropic key
4. Set your preferred output language
5. Click Save Settings

---

## How Each Mode Works

### Live Captions
- Click orb → Select source → Live Captions
- Audio is captured in chunks and sent to `http://127.0.0.1:5001/transcribe`
- `local_whisper_server.py` runs faster-whisper locally with zero API cost
- Captions appear in the overlay at the bottom of your screen
- Works on YouTube, VLC, Google Meet, Zoom, Teams

### Scene Explainer
- Same as above but also captures a screenshot every 4 seconds
- Screenshot + recent audio → GPT-4o Vision → intelligent scene description
- Output: "Teacher is explaining quadratic equations by writing ax²+bx+c=0 on the board"
- NOT: "A man is standing in front of a whiteboard"

### Transcript Notes
- Records everything said during the session
- At end: click Export → full notes file saved to Downloads
- LLM formats it with headings, bullets, and timestamps

### Video Summarizer
- Records captions + scene descriptions throughout
- At end: generates chapter breakdown, key points, and action items
- Exports as Markdown (open in Obsidian, Notion, etc.)

## Google Meet Specific Setup

For Meet, you don't need VB-Cable. The browser captures mic audio directly.

1. Open Google Meet in Chrome
2. Launch ScreenSense → Click orb → Live Captions
3. Select the Chrome window from the source dropdown
4. ScreenSense will transcribe all spoken audio in the meeting

For **capturing other participants' audio** in Meet:
- Go to Meet Settings → Audio → check your microphone is set
- In Windows Sound settings → Recording → enable "Stereo Mix" if available
- Or use VB-Cable with loopback enabled (see VB-Cable step 3 above)

---

## Language Support

ScreenSense uses local faster-whisper, based on Whisper models with broad multilingual support.

In Settings → Output Language, choose your preferred language.
All transcripts, captions, and scene explanations will be delivered in that language
regardless of what language the video is in.

Supported (among others): English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, French, German, Spanish,
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Dutch, Polish,
Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, and 79 more.

## Building for Distribution (optional)

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an `.exe` installer in the `dist/` folder.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Orb doesn't appear:** Check Task Manager for `Electron` process. Try `npm start` again.

**No audio captured:** Make sure VB-Cable is set as default recording device. Check Windows Sound settings.

**"API key invalid":** Double-check your key in Settings. Make sure you have credits on your OpenAI account.

**Scene explainer is slow:** Increase the interval in Settings (every 6 or 10 seconds) to reduce API calls.

**Captions in wrong language:** Go to Settings → Output Language and set your preferred language.
