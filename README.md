## Transcription

Live Captions can use the bundled local Whisper server or your configured Groq/OpenAI API key. Release builds include the local Whisper server, so users do not need to install Python for the default local mode. For development builds, or if the bundled server is missing, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-local-whisper.txt
python local_whisper_server.py
```

Or double-click `start-local-whisper.bat` on Windows.

## For developers

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chanikya07/ScreenSenseAI.git
cd ScreenSenseAI
npm install
npm start
```

To create a release with the bundled local Whisper server:

```bash
npm run build:whisper
npm run build:win
```

Build Windows, macOS, and Linux packages on their matching operating systems so each installer contains the correct local Whisper binary.
